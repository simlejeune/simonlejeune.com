      <h1>Escape the Local Maximum</h1>
      <div class="post-date">February 2026</div>

      <p>Early in my career, I interviewed for a role at Hopper. The CEO, Fred Lalonde, asked me what I would change first to grow revenue. I suggested testing different price points for the $5 tip option. He dismissed it — that's a local maximum.</p>

      <p>He was right. Tweaking the price of a tip from $5 to $7 might move a metric, but it would never transform the business. The real question wasn't "what's the optimal price?" It was "what else could we build with all this data?"</p>

      <p>That conversation changed how I think about growth.</p>

      <h2>The trap</h2>

      <p>Most growth teams are stuck in a loop: run A/B test, find 3% improvement, ship it, repeat. It feels productive. The dashboards go up. But you're climbing a small hill when there's a mountain next to you that you haven't noticed.</p>

      <p>The local maximum is comfortable. You have data. You have process. You have a predictable cadence of "wins." But those wins are capped by the frame you're operating in.</p>

      <h2>How to escape</h2>

      <p>The first step is asking better questions. Not "how do we optimize this?" but "should this exist at all?" Not "how do we improve our ad creative?" but "what if we didn't run ads and built a product that markets itself?"</p>

      <p>At Hopper, we built an ads engine that automated the creation of hundreds of campaigns daily. We didn't optimize ads — we made the concept of manually managing ads obsolete.</p>

      <p>At Wealthsimple, the biggest growth levers weren't marketing optimizations. They were product decisions — launching crypto, launching cash accounts, making tax filing free. Each one opened an entirely new surface area for growth.</p>

      <h2>The uncomfortable part</h2>

      <p>Escaping the local maximum means being willing to abandon what's working. It means telling your team that the thing they spent months optimizing might not matter. It means placing bets that could fail spectacularly.</p>

      <p>Most people don't do this because the local maximum is safe. The global maximum requires you to be wrong for a while before you're right.</p>

      <p>But that's where the real growth is.</p>
